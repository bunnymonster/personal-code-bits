		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<div>
			<p>This page is designed to display either Mandelbrot fractals or Julia Fractals.</p>
			<h3>What are fractals?</h3>
			<p>Fractals are shapes that do not get smooth no matter how much you zoom in. 
			<h3>What is the Mandelbrot Set?</h3>
			<p>The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers where the magnitude of the number remains bounded under iterations of 0 for the function z<sub>n+1</sub>=z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>+c.</p>
			<h3>What are Julia sets?</h3>
			<p>Julia sets are similar to the Mandelbrot set except instead of varying the term c added at the end of each iteration, the c is kept constant and the starting value z<sub>0</sub> that gets squared is the one that varies.</p>
			<h3>What do the colors represent?</h3>
			<p>The colors represent the number of iterations the point represented by the pixel went through before its magnitude exceeded 4.</p>
			<h3>Why 4?</h3>
			<p>The math works out that if a point's magnitude exceeds 4, it will definitely head off to infinity.</p>
			<h3>How to use this page</h3>
			<p>Enter your view window in the minX minY maxX maxY boxes.  Enter the number of iterations in the iterations box. If you are making a Julia set, add in the constant in the form a+bi, where a and b are real numbers. Then press the button for the type of set you want to generate.</p>
